**Sprint Review**:

1. What did you learn from doing this sprint? <br> This sprint involved alot of editing and adjustment to the structure of the site we had already built out in our previous sprints. We learned better collaboration pracitces because this part of our project took more discussion and sharing of ideas as we all worked to find the best solutions for certain problems or aspects of the site that the client was hoping to be different.
<br>

2. What did go well? Why? <br> 
<br>

3. What didnâ€™t go well? Why not? <br> It was difficult for us to figure out how best to portray the portion of the website for users that were alumni and no longer active in the sorority because the primary purpose of the site was points trackign and attendance and that isn't relevant to those users. This made the interface much different. 
<br>

4. How can you make things better next time? <br>
<br>

5. Are you satisfied with what you already completed? <br> We are very satisfied with the work we have completed. We feel as though we are polishing and editing the website where it needs improved interface or functionality but the main structure we have is solid. 
<br>

6. Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present? <br>
