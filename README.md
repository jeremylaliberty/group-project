First Sprint - Assignment 3 Responses 

**Trello Board Link** – https://trello.com/b/jIeSXUdM/gamma-phi-beta-member-system 

**User Stories**
1. As a user, I need a simple, interactive user interface that is easy to understand so that I can see my attendance automatically.
2. As a user, I need a clear points system interface so that I can track the points I have as a member of the organization. 

        Future sprint stories:
        As an administrator, I need to be able to add new members to the system.
        As an administrator, I need to be able to correct any errors in the points and attendance tracking system.
        As a user, I want to be able to network with other members of the organization.

**Sprint Review**

1. What did you learn from doing our first sprint?
Our first sprint taught us that it is highly important to start early and stay on top of the project. We also found that a sprint flies by far quicker than we expected and we are  just getting used to understanding each other's roles and where each of us excel. 

2. What did go well? Why?
Managing all the different tools ended up going well for us. We were all able to access all the project data in Trello and github which we assumed to be far harder prior to actually starting the project. I think this went well because we spent a significant amount of time understanding github ahead of time and understanding Trello. We also did a good job of updating the Trello board and pushing our commits after we finished our work for each day. 

3. What didn’t go well? Why not?
We got caught off guard by the sprint time. We found ourselves thinking we had plenty of time to complete our work, but as the deadline arrived, we were still far behind where we needed to be. We believe the first sprint was a good trial and error since none of us have ever worked with this methodology before. 

4. How can you make things better next time?
Next time, we will start the sprint full force to take advantage of every single day. This will help us accomplish more in a sprint, but also create more value in our project since we will not feel cramped on time in the last few days finishing the sprint. 

5. Are you satisfied with what you already completed?
Our team is relatively satisfied with what we’ve completed, but again, we did think we would fit a lot more into one sprint. We think we were a bit ambitious since none of us have ever done a sprint before and had no basis for knowing how much of our work could be accomplished. At the same time, we think that each sprint could accomplish different amounts of work based on everyone's weekly schedules and the complexity of what we are working on. 

6. Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present?
We worked with team project group 10. Everybody was present at their sprint review and contributed to the conversation. They had an overall smooth sprint with a bit of hiccups in figuring out all the platforms necessary to document the project. Each person took their turn assessing what went well and poorly, and why.
