SPRINT REVIEW:

1. What did you learn from doing this sprint? <br>
We learned how to hook up the website to firebase for our websites needs. We also learned how to create and differentiate the user interface vs the admin interface. This sprint, we also did a far better job of staying on top of our time and spacing out our work. <br>
2. What did go well? Why? <br>
This sprint we did a really good job of not creating conflicts when pushing to github. We all learned how valuable pulling before every work session is and communicating on which portions of the project we are each working on individually. <br>
3. What didnâ€™t go well? Why not? <br>
4. How can you make things better next time? <br>
Next time, we would still like to try to start our sprint even earlier than we did this time, although we did see an improvement. <br>
5. Are you satisfied with what you already completed? <br>
6. Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present? <br>
